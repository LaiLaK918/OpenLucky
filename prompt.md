**CRITICAL WARNING: MULTIPLE ORDERS MARGIN CALCULATION**
When creating multiple orders, you MUST calculate margin requirements cumulatively:
1. If closures provided: Add released margin (imr) to availBal FIRST
2. Order 1 uses: (sz1 × ctVal1 × price1) ÷ leverage1 margin
3. Order 2 can only use remaining balance: (availBal + released_margin) - Order1_margin
4. NEVER calculate each order independently based on full availBal
5. Example: 76 USDT availBal + 136 USDT released from closure = 212 USDT total available

### CRITICAL: Contract Specification and Margin Calculation

**Understanding Contract Size (sz parameter):**
- sz represents the NUMBER OF CONTRACTS, not the trading amount in USDT
- Each contract has a specific contract value (ctVal) denominated in the base currency
- Trading Value = sz × ctVal × Current Price

**Contract Value Examples from Trading Product Information:**
- DOGE-USDT-SWAP: ctVal=1000, means 1 contract = 1000 DOGE
- BTC-USDT-SWAP: ctVal=0.01, means 1 contract = 0.01 BTC  
- MEW-USDT-SWAP: ctVal=1000, means 1 contract = 1000 MEW

**Margin Calculation Formula:**
Required Margin = (sz × ctVal × Entry Price) ÷ Leverage

**Position Sizing Guidelines:**
1. ALWAYS calculate required margin before setting sz
2. Required margin summary must be ≤ Available Balance (availBal)
3. Use this formula to determine maximum safe sz:
   Max sz = (availBal × leverage) ÷ (ctVal × current_price)
4. For risk management, use only 50-80% of maximum calculated sz

**Example Calculation for DOGE-USDT-SWAP:**
- Current price: 0.263590 USDT
- ctVal: 1000 DOGE per contract
- Available balance: 134.65 USDT
- Leverage: 10x

Max safe sz = (134.65 × 10) ÷ (1000 × 0.263590) = 1346.5 ÷ 263.59 = 5.1 contracts
Recommended sz = 5.1 × 0.7 = 3-4 contracts (conservative)

**NEVER set sz without calculating the required margin first!**

### CRITICAL: Multiple Orders Margin Management

**When placing multiple orders simultaneously, you MUST account for cumulative margin usage:**

1. **Calculate orders sequentially, not in parallel**
2. **Deduct each order's margin from remaining available balance**
3. **Never exceed total available balance across all orders**

**Multi-Order Calculation Process:**
```
Step 1: Calculate Order 1 margin = (sz1 × ctVal1 × price1) ÷ leverage1
Step 2: Remaining balance = availBal - Order 1 margin
Step 3: Calculate Order 2 based on remaining balance
        Max sz2 = (remaining_balance × leverage2) ÷ (ctVal2 × price2)
Step 4: Repeat for additional orders
```

**Example with 200 USDT available balance:**
```
Order 1 - PARTI-USDT-SWAP (ctVal=10, price=0.23, leverage=10x):
- Margin needed = (600 × 10 × 0.23) ÷ 10 = 138 USDT
- Remaining = 200 - 138 = 62 USDT

Order 2 - MEW-USDT-SWAP (ctVal=1000, price=0.0036, leverage=10x):
- Max sz = (62 × 10) ÷ (1000 × 0.0036) = 172 contracts
- Do NOT use 400 contracts (would need 144 USDT but only 62 available)
```

**CRITICAL RULE: Total margin for all orders MUST NOT exceed availBal**

### CRITICAL: Position Closure and Margin Release

**When both closures and new trades are provided, closures execute FIRST:**

1. **Closure Priority**: All positions in "closures" array are closed before "trades" execute
2. **Margin Release**: Closing positions releases their Initial Margin (imr) back to Available Balance
3. **Updated Balance**: New trades can use: Original availBal + Released Margin from closures
4. **Calculation Order**: 
   ```
   Step 1: Calculate total margin to be released from closures
   Step 2: Updated availBal = Original availBal + Released margin
   Step 3: Calculate new trades based on updated availBal
   ```

**Example - Closure + New Trade:**
```
Current State:
- availBal = 76.61 USDT
- PARTI-USDT-SWAP position with imr = 136.26 USDT

Closure: Close PARTI-USDT-SWAP
- Released margin = 136.26 USDT
- Updated availBal = 76.61 + 136.26 = 212.87 USDT

New Trade: MEW-USDT-SWAP (ctVal=1000, price=0.003672, leverage=10x)
- Can now use up to 212.87 USDT for margin calculation
- Max sz = (212.87 × 10) ÷ (1000 × 0.003672) = 5,799 contracts
```

**Key Point**: Always account for margin release from closures when calculating new position sizes.
